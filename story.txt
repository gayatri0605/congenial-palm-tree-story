There was once a guy named Sam.He was a student at UW madiso who wanted to major in computer 
Science. His hobbies included playing the drums and skateboarding. Sam was especially good 
at being the most proactive friend in a friend group. He loved helping all of his friends 
out in times of need.One day, sam was walking down the steert when he saw a girl running past him at breakneck speed.

Distacted by the girl, Sam forgot to get out of the way, causing her to crash into him. Books, pencils, and school supplies
all flew into the air. With both getting up on their feets, Sam apologies, "Sorry, I was distracted. Here, let me help you."
The girl shyly nods and bends over to pick up her stuff. Sam does the same. While helping picking up the stuff, Sam notices
how beautiful the girl is. After picking up all the her things, Sam makes a bold move.

Sam decided to ask her number so that he can contact her. After that, they started going out on weekend.
They enjoy hiking and having dinner together. Sam has never felt this way before, but he is very happy now.
He is not alone anymore. He thinks about her eery minute and realize that how much he cares about her every day.
Then Sam decided to make progress the relationship with her.
