There was once a guy named Sam.He was a student at UW madiso who wanted to major in computer 
Science. His hobbies included playing the drums and skateboarding. Sam was especially good 
at being the most proactive friend in a friend group. He loved helping all of his friends 
out in times of need.One day, sam was walking down the steert when he saw a girl running past him at breakneck speed.
